# Motion-Planning-and-Decision-Making-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
implementing
-Behavioral planning logic using Finite State Machines - FSM
-Static objects collision checking.
-Path and trajectory generation using cubic spirals
- Track the centerline on the traveling lane.
## Aim:
- Avoid static objects (cars, bicycles and trucks) parked on the side of the road (but still invading the lane). The vehicle must avoid crashing with these vehicles by executing either a “nudge” or a “lane change” maneuver.
- Handle any type of intersection (3-way, 4-way intersections and roundabouts) by STOPPING in all of them (by default)
- Track the centerline on the traveling lane.
